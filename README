This project will undertake research and development into the use of BuddyPress as an institutional academic profile management tool which aggregates teaching and learning resources as well as research outputs held on third-party websites into the individualâ€™s BuddyPress profile. 

BuddyPress is a social networking plugin for WordPress, the popular Content Management Tool. The University of Lincoln was the first UK university to make BuddyPress available to all staff and students and has followed the development of BuddyPress carefully since its early alpha/beta stages. At the time of writing, over 2500 staff and students have used or are using BuddyPress at the University of Lincoln and we are currently working to make BuddyPress the staff profile management tool for all academic and non-academic staff. 

This proposal seeks funds to investigate and develop BuddyPress to integrate ('consume') third-party feeds and APIs into BuddyPress profiles and, furthermore, investigate the possibility of BuddyPress being used as a 'producer application' for other institutional websites and third-party web services. 

The main outcome of this work will be a plugin or set of plugins that can be used with BuddyPress to extend an individual's profile to re-present resources that are held on disparate websites such as YouTube, Slideshare, Mendeley, Academia.edu, etc. The plugins will be open source and made available via the official WordPress.org plugin repository. Furthermore, through our connection with the CUNY Academic Commons project, we hope to extend our user testing to that project and seek advice from their staff, who are core contributors to BuddyPress.
